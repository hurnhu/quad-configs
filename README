If you would like to add your own scripts just make a PR!

File naming:

For manufacture-configs
MANUFACTURE-MODELNAME-BOARDNAME-FCSOFTWEAR-FCSOFTWEARVR.conf


For user-configs:
MANUFACTURE-MODELNAME-BOARDNAME-CONFIGNAME-FCSOFTWEAR_FCSOFTWEARVR.conf

CONFIGNAME can be anything you want that discribes your config.
Keep it short and sweet.
